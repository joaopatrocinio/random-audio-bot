# random-audio-bot

This is a Discord Bot that plays random audios (.mp3) given in a folder. It uses the Discord.js module and can be easily modified to add more features.

### Setup

You'll need a bot created at https://discordapp.com/developers/ and it's auth token.
After you aquire the token you put in a .env file like this:
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your token here
```

*Note:* do not share this token anywhere else in your code

After that just do `npm install` to install all necessary modules and then `npm start`. A message should appear on the console saying you logged in the bot successfully.
